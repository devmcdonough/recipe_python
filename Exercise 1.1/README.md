# Recipe Command Line Application

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a command line version of a Recipe app. This project serves as a precursor to its web app counterpart, which will be developed in Achievement 2.

## Context
This project focuses on foundational Python skills, data structures, and object-oriented programming. Additionally, it introduces database interactions using Python, which will be valuable when working with the Django web framework in subsequent projects. Mastery of these concepts will also assist in debugging and modifying code, especially when dealing with updates to Django.

## The 5 W's

### Who
This project is targeted toward your professional network and potential employers. It demonstrates your skills in Python programming. While Achievement 2 will result in a portfolio-worthy project, Achievement 1 showcases your ability to script in Python.

### What
The project is a command line application for managing a Recipe app. Users can create, read, and modify recipes, as well as search for recipes based on ingredients.

### When
The code will be available on your GitHub repository. To run the code locally, Python 3.6+ must be installed, which is straightforward to set up. Recruiters can easily access your code to assess your implementation.

### Where
Your code can be executed on any machine with an active Python installation. You may host the code on your GitHub profile or portfolio site for potential employers and your professional network to view.

### Why
This project aims to showcase your understanding of Python fundamentals and your potential to apply this knowledge to web application frameworks like Django.

## User Goals
- Users should be able to create and modify recipes with details such as ingredients, cooking time, and an automatically calculated difficulty level.
- Users should also be able to search for recipes based on ingredients.

## Key Features
- **Recipe Management**: Create and manage recipes stored in a locally hosted MySQL database.
- **Ingredient Search**: Search for recipes containing user-specified ingredients.
- **Automatic Difficulty Rating**: The app will automatically rate each recipe based on its difficulty.
- **Detailed Recipe View**: Display additional details for each recipe, including ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty, upon user request.

## Technical Requirements
- **Error Handling**: The app should handle common exceptions or errors (e.g., during user input or database access) and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Database Connectivity**: The app must connect to a locally hosted MySQL database.
- **User Interface**: Provide an easy-to-use interface with simple inputs and clear instructions. Assume that users may not be as technically proficient.
- **Python Compatibility**: The app should work on Python 3.6+ installations.
- **Code Quality**: Ensure that the code is well-formatted according to standardized guidelines.
- **Comments**: Support the code with concise and helpful comments that illustrate the program's flow.
